# Todo_app
Students often struggle to stay organized and prioritize tasks, so I created a simple CLI-based To-Do app that helps them manage their tasks efficiently. This app is easy to use and designed with students in mind.
To run this app simplyly run "python todo_app.py" in terminal and start using it.
All the task will be stored in "tasks.json" file.
