# Todo_app
Students often struggle to stay organized and prioritize tasks, so I created a simple CLI-based To-Do app that helps them manage their tasks efficiently. The app is easy to use and specifically designed with students in mind.

To run the app, simply execute "python todo_app.py" in the terminal. All tasks will be saved in the "tasks.json" file for future use
